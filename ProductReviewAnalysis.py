#Task 1: Keyword Highlighter: Write a program that searches through reviews list and looks for keywords such as "good", "excellent", 
#"bad", "poor", and "average". We want you to capitalize those keywords then print out each review. Print out each review with the keywords 
#in uppercase so they stand out.

    "This product is really good. I'm impressed with its quality.",
    "The performance of this product is excellent. Highly recommended!",
    "I had a bad experience with this product. It didn't meet my expectations.",
    "Poor quality product. Wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",

#the total count of positive and negative words.

#Ensure that the summary does not cut off in the middle of a word.
